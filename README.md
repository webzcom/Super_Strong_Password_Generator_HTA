Super Strong Password Generator HTA 
This is my simple demo of how to make a super strong password generator.
HTA Applications run on pretty much every version of Microsoft Windows.

This is verison 1.0 Beta, this is a basic working copy.
This code is provided as is for educational puposes.
The strong passwords generated are between 19 and 23 characters long.
The passwords contain random cobinations of numbers, upper and lowercase letters and special characters.
There are two buttons, one to generate a list 10 randomly generated passwords and a resize the windows button.

There may be future updates if I have time to work on it.
