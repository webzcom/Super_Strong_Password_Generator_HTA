Super Strong Password Generator HTA


This is my simple demo of how to make a super strong password generator.

Note: HTA Applications run on pretty much every version of Microsoft Windows.

This is verison 1.0 Beta, this is a basic working copy.
This code is provided as is for educational puposes.


The strong passwords generated are between 19 and 23 characters long.


The passwords contain random cobinations of numbers, upper and lowercase letters and special characters.

To Run:

1. Copy HTA file to your Windows PC.
2. Double Click HTA file.
3. When Prompted, allow application to run.
4. Click Red X on Window to Close

Option buttons:

1. Generate a list 10 randomly generated passwords
2. Resize Window

There may be future updates if I have time to work on it.
